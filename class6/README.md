### Random Modules:
The usage of it when we want the computer to pick a random number in a given range pick a random element from a list. Random Module has a lot of functions like Randit its when you want a random integer the function accepts two integers the first one should be lower than the second one and it generates random number between them, Random if you want a large number and you can multiply it, Choice when you want a Random value from a list, Randrange when you want a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step).

### Risk analysis:
Is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test, then the process of assigning the level of risk is done, and the categorization of the risks takes place. Using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas and after knowing the risks area it would help the developers to reduce the risks.
The possible risks you should have in mind is:
- Use of new hardware
- Use of new technology
- Use of new automation tool
- The sequence of code
- Availability of test resources for the application

And there is some risks cant be avoidable like:
- The time that you allocated for testing
- A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application
- Urgency from the clients to deliver the project
- Incomplete requirements

There is different sets of risks such as: 
- Business Risks: It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer.
- Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.
- Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required.
- Software Risks.

### Test coverage:
Is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase. You know you are doing enough testing if the following is true:
- You rarely get bugs that escape into production.
- You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.
