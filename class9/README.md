### Dunder methods:
Also known as magic methods, they are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes, and are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__.

- Object Initialization: __init__: To construct account objects from the Account class you need a constructor which is the __init__ dunder.
- Object Representation: __repr__: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. __str__: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object.
- Iteration: __len__, __getitem__, __reversed__.
And many more

### Statistics:
Probability: Is the chance of an event happening, an event is some outcome of interest, to calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur. Probability gives us a framework for making predictions about how often events will happen.

Probability provides the theory, while statistics provides the tools to test that theory using data.
The normal distribution refers to a particularly important phenomenon in the realm of probability and statistics.
