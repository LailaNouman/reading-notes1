## Stacks and queues:
##### Stack
A data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

##### Terminologies of stacks:
- Push: Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed. Big O(1)
- Pop: Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. Big O(1)
- Top: This is the top of the stack.
- Peek: When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. Big O(1)
- IsEmpty: Returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false. Big O(1)

Stacks follow the concept of LIFO: which means last IN first OUT or FILO: first IN last OUT.

##### Queue
A linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.

##### Terminologies of queue:
- Enqueue: Nodes or items that are added to the queue. Big O(1)
- Dequeue: Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. Big O(1)
- Front: The front/first Node of the queue. 
- Rear: The rear/last Node of the queue.
- Peek: When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. Big O(1)
- IsEmpty: Returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false. Big O(1)

Queues follow the concept FIFO: which means first IN first OUT or LILO: last IN last OUT
