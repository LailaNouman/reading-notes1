# Class-04:

### Classes:

Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. "self" parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and you can access variables through it. All classes have a function called init(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated, you can use it to assign values to the propertires.

### Recursion:

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly, this means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case. When dealing with recursive functions, keep in mind that each recursive call has its own execution context.

### Pytest fixture:

You can define fixtures using a combination of the pytest.fixture decorator, along with a function definition. A fixture is something to help you with your tests so you dont have to repeat yourself every test youre doing.
