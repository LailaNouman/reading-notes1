### Linear regression in Python
Regression searches for relationships among variables, you need to find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well.
Linear regression calculates the estimators of the regression coefficients or simply the predicted weights.
You can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn.

##### Scikit
Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. Linear_model module contains methods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables.
