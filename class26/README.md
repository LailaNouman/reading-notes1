### Django:
Django’s code is open source and available to all. Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the DSF, with a miniscule budget. Django allows users to define their data models entirely in Python, also it provides them with free access to a rich, dynamic database-access API, while also allowing SQL if needed. With Django, you can take web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours.
