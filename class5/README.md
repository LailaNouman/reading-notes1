### Big O:

Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors, first is running time (complexity time), second is memory space (space complexity) we should consider 4 Key Areas for analysis the factors, onw ia input size and it refers to the size of the parameter values that are read by the algorithm, two units of measurements and there is a 3 measurements of time in order to quantify the running Time: 1- The time in milliseconds from the start of a function execution until it ends, 2- The number of operations that are executed, 3- The number of “Basic Operations” that are executed, in order to quantify Memory Space, we can consider Four Sources of Memory Usage during function run-time: 1- The amount of space needed to hold the code for the algorithm, 2- The amount of space needed to hold the input data, 3- The amount of space needed for the output data, 4- The amount of space needed to hold working space during the calculation, three orders of growth we can describe overall efficiency by using the input size n and measuring the overall Units of Space and Time required for the given input size n. As the value of n grows, the Order of Growth represents the increase in Running Time or Memory Space, four Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case, Worst Case: The efficiency for the worst possible input of size n, Best Case: The efficiency for the best possible input of size n, Average Case: The efficiency for a “typical” or “random” input of size n. Big O’s role in algorithm efficiency is to describe the Worst Case of efficiency an algorithm can have in performing it’s job.

### LinkedList:

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. Linked lists are linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed, in order to get to the end of the list, we have to go through all of the items in the list in order, or sequentially. There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly, Singly: refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list, Doubly: refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
