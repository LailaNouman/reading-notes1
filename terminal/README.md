# Practice In the Terminal

## The Command Line
A command line is a text based interface to the system. You will be able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard.

The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt.
Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running commands for you.
