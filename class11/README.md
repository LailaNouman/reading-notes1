### Jupyter lab
JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

- Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output.
- Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.
- Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.
- Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers.

JupyterLab understands many file formats like images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, and many more.

JupyterLab offers customizable keyboard shortcuts and the ability to use key maps from vim, emacs, and Sublime Text in the text editor.

### NumPy
Is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem.

NumPy makes it simple to perform mathematical operations on arrays. This is one of the primary advantages of NumPy, and makes it quite easy to do computations, NumPy also has several methods that you can use for more complex calculations on arrays, example of this is the numpy.ndarray.sum method, this finds the sum of all the elements in an array by default.
