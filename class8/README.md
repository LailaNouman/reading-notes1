### List comprehensions:
List comprehension is a powerful and concise method for creating lists in Python.
- Syntax: my_new_list = [ expression for item in list ]
1- First is the expression we’d like to carry out. expression inside the square brackets.
2- Second is the object that the expression will work on. item inside the square brackets.
3- Finally, we need an iterable list of objects to build our new list from. list inside the square brackets.

- List comprehension methods are an elegant way to create and manage lists. 
- In Python, list comprehensions are a more compact way of creating lists. 
- More flexible than for loops, list comprehension is usually faster than other methods.

List comprehensions reduce the code necessary to complete rather complicated task when working with a list.

### Primer Decorators:
A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. Decorators provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions.
In Python, functions are first-class objects. This means that functions can be passed around and used as arguments. It’s possible to define functions inside other functions. Such functions are called inner functions.
You can use the decorator with the @ symbol.
